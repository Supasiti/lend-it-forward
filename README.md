If you would like to work on a copy of this web application, you can follow these steps to set it up.

### Step 1: Load and install all dependencies

To use this project, first clone the repo on your device using the commands below:

    git clone https://github.com/Supasiti/lend-it-forward.git

Then install all the required libraries by running the follow command

    npm run install 

### Step 2: Setting up MongoDB on Mongo Atlas and Cloudinary

After installing all the dependencies, you would need to set up Mongo database. An instruction on how to set it up on Mongo Atlas can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com). In addition, you will need to set up an account with Cloudinary [here](https://cloudinary.com) and obtain your credential [here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/how_to_integrate_cloudinary#3_add_upload_capabilities).

After setting up Mongo Atlas and Cloudinary, you would need to set up your local environment variables. On the root folder, create and open `.env` file:

    lend-it-forward> cd server
    server> touch .env
    server> open .env

In the `.env` file, enter all the following details:

    MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv....
    JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>

    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<YOUR CLOUD NAME>
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY>
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<YOUR API SECRET>

### Step 3: Optional set up

To install any develop dependencies, you will need to go run `npm i --save-dev` in the `root`, `server` and  `client` folders.

    lend-it-forward> npm i --save-dev
    server> npm i --save-dev
    client> npm i --save-dev
